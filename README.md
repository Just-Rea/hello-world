# hello-world
A briefcase of ideas

Good day and welcome,

My name is Reamogetse however my friends call me Rea (slothsðŸ˜’).
I am from a small town in Limpopo.
I enjoy coding and clinical psychology, If I can merge the two in future,
it would lead to complete joy.

I think html and css are fun languages to learn and do.
I love the idea of making something BEAUTIFUL to look at and user-friendly.

I believe in minimalism and all it has to offer - simplicity.

Last but not least, I am looking forward to growing as a developer. ðŸ’»ðŸŽˆ
